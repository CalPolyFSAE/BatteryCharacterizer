 * Project Desc.: Code to characterize batteries: MCU charges
 * batteries to 3.6-3.8V, then does 30A CC discharge to determine
 * ESR then charges to 4.2V, then discharges at 30W CP discharge
 * monitoring current, voltage and time to get energy, then
 * recharges battery to 3.6-3.7V while writing data to values on
 * spreadsheet on computer that it's connected to.
